# **OrbitAI: To-Do List**
---

## All Orbiters:
* Read https://celestrak.org/columns/
- What you'll learn: some space physics and science about orbits.
  * Not very long.
 
  
* Write scripts for pulling data from the following sites (follow API documentation):
- What you'll learn: python scripting, API calls.
  * https://discosweb.esoc.esa.int/
  * https://www.space-track.org/ 


* Convert both arrays to Pandas Dataframes.
- What you'll learn: feature engineering, pandas, data science.
  * Drop missing values.
  * Merge both Dataframes into one.
  * Feature engineering.


## Advanced:
* Understand the math behind equations.
* Calculate the orbits based on collected data.
* Calculate the intersections between the satellite of interest (self object) and all other space debris/satellites.
  * Store them in the output column. These intersections represent potential collisions.
